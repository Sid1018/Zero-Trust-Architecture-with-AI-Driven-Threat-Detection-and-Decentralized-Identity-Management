# Zero-Trust-Architecture-with-AI-Driven-Threat-Detection-and-Decentralized-Identity-Management
This project aims to enhance security by implementing a Zero Trust security model, AI-driven threat detection, and decentralized identity management. The solution ensures continuous verification, minimal access, real-time threat detection, and secure user authentication.

## Overview
The project integrates three main components:
1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Implements a security model where no one, whether inside or outside the organization, is trusted by default. Continuous verification and minimal access principles are applied.
2. **AI-Driven Threat Detection**: Uses AI to detect unusual activities or potential security breaches in real-time, providing advanced threat detection and response capabilities.
3. **Decentralized Identity Management**: Utilizes decentralized identity systems where users have full control over their digital identities and can securely authenticate without relying on a central authority.

## Features
### Zero Trust Architecture
- Continuous verification of user permissions before granting access.
- Minimal access principles ensuring users have only the necessary permissions.

### AI-Driven Threat Detection
- Real-time threat detection using a pre-trained BERT model.
- Analyzes user activities and identifies potential threats.

### Decentralized Identity Management
- RSA key-based identity generation and verification.
- Secure user authentication without relying on a central authority.

## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Google Colab account
- Required Python libraries: `flask`, `flask-ngrok`, `transformers`, `cryptography`, `torch`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sid1018/zero-trust-security.git
   cd zero-trust-security
   ```

2. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
   - `Zero_Trust_Security.ipynb`

3. Install the required libraries within the notebook:
   ```python
   !pip install flask-ngrok flask transformers cryptography
   ```

4. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code.

## Usage
### Access Control
1. Load the `Zero_Trust_Security.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to start the Flask API.
3. Use the `/access` endpoint to send POST requests with `user_id` and `action` to verify user permissions.

### Threat Detection
1. Send POST requests to the `/monitor` endpoint with `activity` to detect potential threats.

### User Registration and Authentication
1. Send POST requests to the `/register` endpoint with `user_id` to register a new user.
2. Send POST requests to the `/authenticate` endpoint with `user_id`, `message`, and `signature` to authenticate a user.
